Animals Ahoy!
Given a list of REST endpoints, write an infinite scrollable page that loads farm animal
images which are not duplicate of each other.
1. Every rest endpoint will give you a URL of an image. Image of an animal
2. The animal has be shown below in the page, and based on scrollbar movement, it
should load more
3. Images *will* repeat in the API response (which is random). But it should not repeat
in your display
